Using Jupyter Lab
-----------------

Jupyter Lab is a powerful tool for interactive data analysis. It is a web-based
interactive development environment that allows you to combine code, text, and
visualizations in a single document. It is particularly useful for exploratory
data analysis and for sharing your analysis with others.

While Jupyter Lab is not required to use pyxem, it is highly recommended. The
`Basic Usage <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/basic_usage.html>`_ section of
the HyperSpy documentation contains a lot of useful information on how to use Jupyter Lab from
a command line interface or using the context menu included with the Hyperspy bundle on windows
computers.

We also highly recommend using Jupyter Lab to publish full analysis workflows. This is a great way
to share your analysis with others and to make your analysis reproducible!
