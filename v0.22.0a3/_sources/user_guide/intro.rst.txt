The user guide contains more detailed information on how to use pyxem. It helps
you get started with pyxem and contains more detailed information on how to use the
different features of pyxem.

There are a number of resources available to help you get started with pyxem:

- :ref:`Installation`: Recommended instructions to install pyxem.
- :ref:`Examples<examples-index>`: A collection of small scripts and snippets of code to help perform common
  operations. This is a good place to start if you want to build your own analysis.
- :ref:`Tutorials`: A collection of tutorials and workflows to help you get started with a wide
  range of analysis techniques. These are more detailed than the examples and are designed
  as complete workflows.
- :ref:`API Reference`: The API reference contains a description of all the functions and classes
  in pyxem. This is useful if you are looking for a specific function or want to know what
  a function does/what arguments it takes. It also includes some more detailed information
  on what a function does.

Additionally, there is a bibliography of papers that have used pyxem and a list of related
projects.

pyxem inherits lots of functionality from HyperSpy. We suggest that you
also check out the `HyperSpy documentation <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/>`_ for
more information and additional resources. All of the HyperSpy documentation is relevant to
pyxem. Especially the `Big Data <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/dev/user_guide/big_data.html>`_ section,
which has lots of useful information on how to work with large datasets.
