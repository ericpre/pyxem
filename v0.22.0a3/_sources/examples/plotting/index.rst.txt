    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Sometimes you might want to plot using different units, such as pixel coordinates, or mrad or nm^-1. Pyxem makes it easy to plot using different units.  This does require certain calibration information to be set, such as the beam energy and the pixel size.">

With HyperSpy&#x27;s interactive tools we can fairly easily create a line profile that we can interactively adjust to measure the distance between two disks in a diffraction pattern.">
