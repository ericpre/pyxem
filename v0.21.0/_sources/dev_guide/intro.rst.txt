pyxem is a community project maintained for and by its users.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports,
feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

The best way to get started is to start using pyxem and share your workflows and data with
us and the community. You can do this by adding notebooks to the ``pyxem-demos`` which will then be hosted in
the :doc:`/tutorials/index` section of the documentation

If you have snippits of code that you think would be useful to others, you can also add them to the
:ref:`examples<examples-index>` section of the documentation. This is a great way to share your
workflows and data with the community!


The :ref:`contributing` section of the documentation contains more information on how to
create a pull request and contribute to the code base!
